/*
 * Each number key on a standard phone keypad has a set of Latin letters written on
 * it as well: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Telephone-keypad2.svg
 *
 * Businesses often try to come up with clever ways to spell out their phone number
 * in advertisements to make it more memorable. But there are a lot of combinations!
 *
 * Write a function that takes up to four digits of a phone number, and
 * returns a list of all of the words that can be written on the phone with
 * that number. (You should return all permutations, not only English words.)
 *
 * Example:
 *   telephoneWords('2745');
 *   => ['APGJ',
 *        'APGK',
 *        'APGL',
 *        ..., // many many more of these
 *        'CSIL']
 *
 * Tips:
 *   - Phone numbers are strings! (A phone number can start with a zero.)
 *   - The digits 0 and 1 do not have letters associated with them, so they should be left as numbers.
 *   - Don't return every combination of those digits in any order, just the order given.
